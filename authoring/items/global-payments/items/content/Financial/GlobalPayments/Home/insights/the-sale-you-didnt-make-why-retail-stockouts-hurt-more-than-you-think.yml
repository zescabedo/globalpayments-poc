        <p><strong>Stockouts don’t just cost you sales. They cost you customers. But finding a fix isn’t easy. Inventory management challenges are notoriously frustrating — and costly. </strong><strong>So</strong><strong> we decided to get to the bottom of how real retailers are handling the issue.</strong></p><p>In our new report, <a href="https://www.globalpayments.com/insights/unpacking-the-truth-about-retail-inventory-report"><em>Unpacking the truth about inventory</em></a>, we found that even occasional issues with stock levels can lead to permanent losses — we’re talking up to 25% of customers gone for good.</p><p><a href="https://www.globalpayments.com/point-of-sale/retail">Small retail businesses</a> gave us the inside scoop on why it happens, what exactly it’s costing them and how they address the issue when it occurs in their shop.</p><p>But first, let’s cover the basics.</p><h3>What is a stockout?</h3><p>Just like it sounds, a stockout occurs when you run out of inventory for a product and can’t meet customer demand. This could look like a customer making it to the checkout counter ready to buy a product, only to be turned away empty handed because the product they’re asking for isn’t on the floor <em>or</em> in the stockroom.</p><p>It’s a painful experience for the customer and the retailer, but it happens more often than you might think.</p><h3>What’s causing the stockout spiral?</h3><p>According to the small businesses we surveyed, stockouts happen for three key reasons:</p><ol><li>Blind spots</li><li>Manual processes</li><li>Disconnected systems</li></ol><p>Whether it’s human errors caused by manual counting or communication issues between systems that don’t talk to each other, when you have inventory visibility challenges the outcome is the same: instead of being in control, you’re left playing catch-up. Worse? It hurts customer loyalty and revenue.</p><h3>The real-world cost of retail stockouts</h3><p>Customers may forgive once. But not always twice. In a world of options, they’re more likely to try the next store rather than give repeat chances to the one that let them down.</p><p>Let that sink in: One missing item can have a lasting — and negative — impact on repeat business. Understanding how to prevent stockouts isn’t just a smart move. It’s a must.</p><h3>4 patchwork fixes</h3><p>When stockouts happen, most retailers go hands-on. Here are the four biggest ways retailers try to staunch the customer leak after a stockout incident.</p><p>The damage control doesn’t stop there. Some retailers will even shell out $50–$150 to overnight a product to a disappointed customer. That’s a big price for a small item — especially when it keeps happening.</p><h3>How to prevent inventory stockouts</h3><p>Running a small business means you wear a lot of hats. But one of the most important? Inventory manager. Knowing what’s in stock — and when — isn’t just a back-office task. Inventory control is your customer retention strategy and the key to meeting customer demand.</p><p>Here’s the good news: You can do more than just put a bandaid on stockouts. You can prevent them from happening in the first place.</p><p>If you want to see how other small retailers are putting a stop to stockouts and creating better visibility with real-time data, we’ve got just the thing: original insights from real retailers.</p><h3>Discover the truth about inventory from 200 retailers</h3><p><a href="https://www.globalpayments.com/insights/unpacking-the-truth-about-retail-inventory-report"><strong>Download the full report</strong></a></p>
