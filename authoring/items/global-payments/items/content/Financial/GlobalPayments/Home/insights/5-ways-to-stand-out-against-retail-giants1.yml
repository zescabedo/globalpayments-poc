        <p><strong>What really sets you apart as a small business retail owner? Own it.</strong></p><p>Let me be honest: No one loves a big box store. So why do they shop there? The price, the speed, the convenience. But your store? People love your store. The vibe, the warmth, the attention to detail and the way your team greets them by name. That’s your edge, and it’s powerful.</p><p>As a former retail small business owner and now managing how we build products at Global Payments, I know how hard it is to stand out when the competition includes ecommerce giants and national chains. But I also know this: Small retailers aren’t just surviving — they’re gaining ground. In this blog, I’m sharing the most actionable takeaways from <a href="https://discover-lp.globalpayments.com/david-vs-goliath-webinar-reg.html">our recent webinar, “David vs. Goliath: Taking on Amazon and the big box giants.”</a></p><p>I was joined by my colleagues Keenan Kok-Carlson and Neeharika Nagisetty. Together, we dug into how small retailers can build stronger customer loyalty, create standout in-person experiences and use simple digital tools to punch way above their weight. If you’re looking to grow your business — and keep customers coming through your doors — keep reading.</p><p><strong>Why being small is your superpower</strong></p><p>There’s no sugarcoating it: Big stores have scale. But what they don’t have is soul.</p><p>And right now, shoppers are noticing. While headlines focus on national chains, there’s a quiet shift happening. Consumer spending at small businesses is up. In fact, many shoppers are going out of their way to support local — especially when the experience feels personal and the products are unique.</p><p>But being small doesn’t mean you have it easy. You’re juggling everything: hitting revenue goals, managing costs, meeting rising customer expectations — and doing it all with limited resources. That’s exactly why it’s so important to double down on what makes your store different: your people, your story, your products and the magic of a truly personal experience.</p><p><strong>Top 5 tips to use today</strong></p><p>Here are five simple ways to boost your visibility, loyalty and community connection with your small business retail store and compete against retail giants:</p><ol><li><strong>Claim your Google Business Profile</strong> and keep it updated weekly.</li><li><strong>Start a simple loyalty program</strong> — punch card, birthday coupon or buy 2 get 1 free.</li><li><strong>Host a one-night event</strong> with another local business (wine tasting, art show, book signing).</li><li><strong>Use your POS data</strong> to spot trends and bundle slower-moving items with bestsellers.</li><li><strong>Make your packaging memorable</strong> — branded bags, tissue paper or even a tiny surprise.</li></ol><p><img height="427" width="640" alt="Shoppers in a cosmetics store" src="-/media/DDB8F4E4-B1F4-40B1-8ADD-62D16280B7C4.ashx" /></p><p><strong>People come back for the experience, not just the product</strong></p><p>Your product matters. But the reason people come back? That’s all about how you make them feel.</p><p>Think about it. At my local jewelry store, the way they wrap a purchase — gorgeous branded bags, free gift wrap during the holidays — turns a simple transaction into a moment. At our local grocery store, the team still carries your bags to the car and stocks locally made gifts you won’t find at national chains. That’s what turns customers into regulars and regulars into fans.</p><p>If you want to stand out, think about what makes shopping with you feel different. Can you hand-write thank-you notes? Offer small, unexpected freebies? Curate hard-to-find items? These little touches don’t just compete, they win hearts, which is what makes being small so special.</p><p><strong>Loyalty programs don’t have to be fancy, they just have to work</strong></p><p>According to Kok-Carlson, loyal customers aren’t just more likely to return — they’re often willing to spend more. A 5% increase in customer retention can drive up to 95% more revenue over time1. That’s a stat worth paying attention to.</p><p>The good news? Loyalty doesn’t have to mean building a complex points system. Start small. A punch card for every purchase. A birthday discount. Exclusive early access to new products. Whatever you choose, the key is simplicity. Your customers should understand it right away and actually want to use it.</p><p>And if you’re using <a href="https://www.globalpayments.com/point-of-sale/retail">a point of sale system with built-in loyalty features</a>, take the time to activate and customize them. Make it fun. Make it feel like a reward, not a task. A good loyalty program feels like a gift, not a gimmick.</p><p><strong>Turn your store into a destination worth visiting</strong></p><p>You can’t out-Amazon Amazon. But you can be the place people want to spend a Saturday.</p><p>I’ve seen it firsthand: game nights hosted at a local restaurant. Hand-lettering workshops inside a boutique. Gift-wrapping parties during the holidays. All of it creates community and drives sales.</p><p>Think about creative ways to bring people through the door, especially after hours. Can you partner with a local artist? Host a paint-and-sip event? Offer commissions to other local makers who want to sell their work through your store?</p><p>And don’t stop there. Build alliances with other shops in your area. I used to be part of a downtown merchants’ association that pooled marketing budgets and co-hosted holiday events. I also chaired a retail trades committee through our chamber of commerce, where every year we gave away $10,000 in prizes — but customers had to spend that money at participating small businesses. That’s the kind of win-win that gets people excited to shop local.</p><p><img height="427" width="640" alt="Young woman trying on clothes with friends in boutique" src="-/media/60D85E7F-7114-44BD-8D8A-5236DF50F697.ashx" /></p><p><strong>Don’t just compete on style. Show up online, too</strong></p><p>It’s tempting to think that standing out in person is enough. But digital visibility is table stakes now. That doesn’t mean you need a full-time social media manager. It means using free tools already at your fingertips.</p><p>Kok-Carlson shared how a pancake-loving restaurant in Chicago built a 3-million-strong following with nothing but silly videos and a smartphone. That kind of creative, human content can drive serious foot traffic.</p><p>Start with the basics: Claim your Google Business Profile. Post weekly on Instagram or TikTok, even if it’s just to show off a new display or introduce your staff. Use <a href="https://www.globalpayments.com/point-of-sale/retail">your POS data</a> to see what’s selling and promote those items online. And don’t forget reputation management: Responding to reviews (even the negative ones) shows you care.</p><p><strong>A final thought</strong></p><p>Small businesses aren’t just part of the economy — they’re the heartbeat of the community. When you put care into what you offer, how you serve and how you show up, people notice. They come back. They tell their friends. Seriously, I personally interact with every social post I see of local businesses, even if it's just a 'like'. It's my way of saying, ‘I support you too.’</p><p>You don’t have to be the biggest. You just have to be the most you.</p><p>As I said during the webinar, every small retail business is a dream in motion. When you support one, you’re not just buying a product — you’re investing in someone’s story. And I’m proud to keep building tools and products that help that story keep growing.</p><p>Inspired? <a href="https://discover-lp.globalpayments.com/david-vs-goliath-webinar-reg.html">Watch the webinar</a> for more tips on how to stand out among retail giants.</p>
