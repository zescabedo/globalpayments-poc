        <p>As CMS and NCQA accelerate the transition toward digital quality measures (dQMs), health plans must strengthen their digital data infrastructure to meet new expectations. The shift from hybrid to digital-first reporting requires cleaner data, stronger interoperability, and automated quality workflows that reduce dependency on manual chart review. Organizations preparing early are seeing measurable gains in accuracy, efficiency, and performance forecasting.</p>
        <p>Vitalis helps health plans build a foundation for digital measure readiness through a unified, FHIR-native environment that consolidates clinical data from EHRs, HIEs, registries, and claims systems. By automating ingestion, validation, and normalization, Vitalis eliminates common barriers to data completeness and ensures teams are working from reliable information. This reduces the friction associated with measure interpretation and accelerates intervention cycles throughout the year.</p>
        <p>Beyond technical readiness, digital transformation requires operational alignment. Vitalis supports quality, data, analytics, and provider relations teams with real-time dashboards, automated measure logic, and AI-driven workflows that surface gaps earlier and help teams collaborate effectively. As the industry moves toward full digital reporting by 2026 and beyond, health plans leveraging platforms like Vitalis are positioned to lead the next era of measurement modernization.</p>
