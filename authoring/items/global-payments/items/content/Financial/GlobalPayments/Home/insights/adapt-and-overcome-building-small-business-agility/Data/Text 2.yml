      Value: "<h2>What is business agility?</h2><p>Agile principles require you to be fast and flexible—ready to turn on a dime to handle market changes like shifting customer needs or the release of new technology. That means making important decisions quickly—changing what you sell or how your business is structured to manage threats or seize opportunities.</p><p>Basically, you want to move toward your goal without losing momentum, regardless of the setbacks or surprises that pop up.</p><p>The agile framework emerged from software development in the early 2000s, but you may be more familiar with it than you think. If you were in business before the pandemic, you likely had to pivot to survive. If so, you’ve had an exercise in agility.</p>"
