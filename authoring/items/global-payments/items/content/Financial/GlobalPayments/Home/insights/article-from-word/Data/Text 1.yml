        <p><strong>The truth is, customers don’t always abandon their carts because they don’t want to buy — they leave them because online retailers make it too hard. Long forms, extra clicks, slow logins — every step you add to the checkout process increases the chance your customers will drop off and buy elsewhere.</strong></p><p><strong>But a few, surprisingly simple steps can supercharge your conversion rates overnight. In our recent webinar, </strong><a href="https://contact.globalpayments.com/browsers-to-buyers-guide/"><strong>Turn Browsers into Buyers guide</strong></a><strong>, we share three proven strategies for capturing more online sales. With decades of experience in </strong><a href="https://www.globalpayments.com/payments/online"><strong>ecommerce payments</strong></a><strong> at Global Payments, we break down common checkout pitfalls and highlight the small yet powerful tweaks you can make quickly.</strong></p><p><strong>“In reality, these are the types of roadblocks that we've weirdly gotten used to having to deal with,” Mark Hagan says. “But with some very specific tweaks you can see around a 35% increase for most ecomm sites.”</strong></p><p><strong>For small retailers, that’s a big chunk of change for just a few minor adjustments. <em>Baymard</em> found that there’s up to $260 billion in revenue just waiting for small retailers to tap into — revenue that these experts provide a proven framework to attain.</strong></p>
